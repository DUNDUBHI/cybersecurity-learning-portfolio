# 📨 Corporate Email Breach Investigation

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **digital forensics investigation** of a suspicious corporate email suspected to be part of a phishing campaign.  
The analysis was performed entirely in **Kali Linux**, using forensic tools and command-line techniques.

- Documented findings in a forensic-style report  

## 📑 Deliverables
